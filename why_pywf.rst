The Python Workflow (pywf) library addresses a common challenge faced by developers managing multiple Python projects: the inconsistency of workflows across different project types. In my experience maintaining approximately 150 open source projects, 50 closed source projects, and 30 application-type projects, I've observed that while the high-level concepts remain consistent, the implementation details vary significantly. For example, when installing dependencies, an open source project might use a simple pip install -r requirements.txt command, while an application project requiring deterministic dependencies might use Pipenv. Similarly, documentation hosting differs - public projects typically leverage GitHub and ReadtheDocs, while private projects need separate private hosting solutions. These differences create cognitive overhead when switching between projects, as developers must remember different commands and processes for essentially the same conceptual task.

The pywf library solves this problem by normalizing these common behaviors through a unified command interface. Regardless of which project I'm working on, I can simply type make install to install dependencies, and the appropriate underlying mechanism (pip, Pipenv, etc.) will be used based on the project type. Similarly, make test will run unit tests using the project's preferred testing framework. This approach dramatically reduces the mental burden of context-switching between projects while ensuring consistent and reproducible workflows. Each project type has its own dedicated pywf library that implements the lower-level operational logic, abstracting away the implementation details while maintaining the conceptual similarity. Additionally, I've created cookiecutter templates for each project type that automatically wire up the appropriate pywf library, enabling rapid creation of new project skeletons. This comprehensive system ensures that whether I'm developing a pip-installable library, a private package published to a private repository, or a deployable application that doesn't need pip installation at all, the day-to-day development commands remain consistent and intuitive.RetryClaude can make mistakes.
